				<h3><a href="https://www.americasarmy.com/">America's Army Proving Grounds</a></h3>
				<p>It is the best online FPS game I have ever played in my life. America's army proving grounds (AAPG) is the official game of U.S Army. It is very realistic. Every movement, guns, reactions, recoils, explosions all are realistic comparing to other popular games like CS:GO. It has a fun melee attack and very much enjoyable. Melee system is chocking while the enemy's back is infront of you or the enemy is laying down. It has several maps both BDX and flo. Basically there are two teams. One attacking and another defending. So It is a team game. You can play it for free in both PC and PS4(beta). It is available in steam for free to play.

				<h3><a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends">APEX LEGENDS</a></h3>
				<p>Apex Legends is an online fast paced battle royal game developed by EA. It's kinda like pubg. But so much more is there than pubg. You can play with your friends in duo or trio. Unlike pubg you can play with various legends i.e character. Each legend has his own powers and abilities. Thus makes the game more dependant on teamplay and fun. It is totally free. You can download it from steam directly. Here is the link --- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/">Apex Legends</a><small> (Steam Link)</small>

				<h3><a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/">Counter Strike : Global Offense</a></h3>
				<p>It is one of the most popular FPS games in the world. Counter Strike has several versions. But this one is the most popular. It is so fun playing the game. But it is not realistic like AAPG. Rifles have recoils. That is nice. But the sniper scope does not move. It is steady. It does not move with your breath. And so there is no system of holding breath. It has a melee attack with a knife. But AAPG has the melee of chocking. In addition, It can be palyed as a team, even all alone system. However, it does not need a very high specs pc. There are so many tournaments held in that game every year. It is free to play now on steam. But you can purchase the game to gain premium membership. Check it out.
